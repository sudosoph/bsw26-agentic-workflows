TITLE: Show HN: BSW Growth Agent — open-source customer-discovery

URL:   https://github.com/sudosoph/bsw-growth-agent
```

**First comment to seed the thread:**
```
hey hn · sophia here · i built this as a teaching artifact for a
boulder startup week workshop today.

it's a customer-discovery agent that runs on a daily cron, listens
to hn / reddit / product hunt for icp signals, drafts personalized
outreach in your voice, and drops it in gmail drafts. never sends
without you. mit licensed.

architecture: n8n + claude or groq + jina or firecrawl + google
sheets/drive/gmail. ~$8-15/mo on the lean stack, or $0 on groq +
jina free tier.

repo includes:
· 17-step code-along tutorial (no n8n experience required)
· config-as-files pattern (voice.md, icp.md, schemas.md as drive files)
· cascade pattern (haiku for routing, sonnet for drafting · 60-70% bill cut)
· 4-stage trust ladder for going from hitl to full auto with guardrails
· autopilot prompt for claude for chrome / gemini / operator users
· a "lite" workflow using groq + jina for the truly free path
· 50-slide workshop deck if you want the speaker context

questions welcome. fork and ship.

## A note on cadence

Don't try to post all of this on Thursday afternoon. Pace it:

| When | What |
|---|---|
| Wed 7 PM | Pre-talk teaser tweet on X |
| Thu 1 PM (immediately after talk) | Post-talk X announcement · attendee email |
| Thu 4 PM | Boulder community Slack/email seeds (AI Builders, Flatirons, RMAIIG) |
| Thu 8 PM | Hacker News submission (if you want HN traction · best timing is 8-10 PM PT for next morning) |
| Fri 9 AM | Follow-up X post with star count + audit availability |
| Sat | Recap post drafted on Substack · scheduled for Sun morning |
| Sun 9 AM | Newsletter / recap goes out via Substack |

You don't have to do all of these. The minimum-viable post-talk plan is:

1. Email to attendees (Thursday)
2. X announcement (Thursday)
3. Substack recap (over the weekend)

Skip the rest if you're tired. You just gave a workshop — give yourself the weekend if you need it.

## Substack-specific notes

If `agenticarchitect.ai/blog` redirects to a Substack:

- The "attendee email" template above is the right format for a Substack post · paste it as a regular post (not a comment), set the audience to the people who signed up at the workshop, and check "Send as email and post to web."
- The recap blog draft (in `RECAP-BLOG-DRAFT.md`) is also Substack-ready · drop it into the Substack editor, add 1–2 photos, and schedule for Sunday morning.
- For ongoing newsletter cadence: weekly is too aggressive when you're starting · pick every-other-Tuesday and stick to it.

---

## X (Twitter) thread option · if you want more reach Thursday

Instead of one big tweet, post the announcement as a 5-tweet thread for better engagement:

```
1/ just shipped the bsw growth agent live with 200+ founders in
   the room.

   a customer-discovery agent that runs while you sleep · n8n +
   claude or groq + gmail · mit licensed.

   github.com/sudosoph/bsw-growth-agent
```

```
2/ the demo:
   · listens to hn / reddit / product hunt for icp signals
   · drafts personalized outreach in your voice
   · drops in gmail drafts · NEVER sends without you
   · 5 drafts a day · ~10 sec to approve each
   · 50 hours/month back

   that's the 10x output math the workshop description promised.
```

```
3/ patterns we covered (memorize these · tools change, patterns don't):
   · cron + webhook triggers
   · config-as-files (voice.md, icp.md as drive files · not
     buried in workflow nodes)
   · cascade pattern · haiku for routing, sonnet for nuance ·
     60-70% bill cut
   · idempotent dedup · re-run safety
   · hitl via gmail drafts
```

```
4/ cost roadmap · same agent, five tiers:
   tier 0 · FREE · groq + jina + n8n trial · zero install
   tier 1 · all-cloud SaaS · ~$135/mo
   tier 3 · lean self-hosted · ~$15/mo
   tier 4 · max DIY w/ local qwen · ~$8/mo

   most underused 2026 lever: the cascade. cuts bills 60-70%.
```

```
5/ if you're an early-stage founder still doing outbound by hand:
   fork it · github.com/sudosoph/bsw-growth-agent

   if you want to talk through what to automate first ·
   5 free 30-min audits for bsw attendees:
   cal.com/sudosoph/architect-audit-bsw

   weekly deep-dives at agenticarchitect.ai/blog
