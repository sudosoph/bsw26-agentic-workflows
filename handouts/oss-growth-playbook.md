# The OSS Growth Playbook
## How AI Tools Grow — and How Your Startup Can Use the Same Playbook

## The 4-step pattern

Every AI tool we used in the workshop today followed this exact pattern:

1. **Ship something genuinely useful.** Not a marketing demo. Not a slide deck. Useful, in production, on day one.
2. **License it permissively.** Apache 2.0 or MIT. People won't fork what they can't use commercially.
3. **Build distribution and community trust.** Free first. Be everywhere. Solve real problems for real people.
4. **Monetize the slice nobody wants to self-host.** Managed cloud. Enterprise SSO. Premium support. Datasets. Training. The thing the user actively wants to pay for.

## Why it works in 2026

- **Distribution is the moat now.** Differentiation is a 2-week head start; distribution is a 2-year head start.
- **Founder taste is the new craft.** The discriminator isn't who CAN build the tool — it's who shipped a USEFUL one first.
- **AI lowered the cost of "shipping something useful"** from a 4-engineer team to a solo founder over a weekend. The funnel-top is wider than ever.
- **Buyers trust open source.** When your stack might run for years, locked-down vendors look fragile.

## How to apply this to YOUR startup — 5 concrete moves this month

### Move 1 — Open-source one internal tool that solves a niche pain
Look at the scripts and tools you've built for yourselves over the last 6 months. The ones you'd happily share with another founder. Pick the smallest, sharpest one. License MIT. Drop a README. Ship to GitHub. **Distribution often starts with a single 200-star repo.**

### Move 2 — Publish a high-quality template
n8n template. Claude prompt. CSV schema. Bash script. A README that makes it easy. **Templates beat tutorials** because they ship value before requiring time investment. The Founder's Discovery Engine you got from this workshop is exactly this — fork it, configure it, become the n8n template author for your niche.

### Move 3 — Write 5 deep-dive blog posts that document your craft
Pick one technical thing you do well. Write it down with code, screenshots, decisions, and dead-ends. Don't gatekeep. SEO won't help you in 2026 — referrals will, and a deep-dive post that's *the best on the internet* about a specific topic gets shared by exactly the people you want to reach. **My recommendation:** start a blog. Mine is at agenticarchitect.ai/blog if you want a model.

### Move 4 — Sponsor or contribute to one OSS tool you use
Find the tool you can't live without. Send the maintainer $20/month, or open one substantive PR. **You'll learn the codebase**, build a relationship with someone whose audience overlaps yours, and earn long-term goodwill. It's the cheapest BD you'll ever do.

### Move 5 — Treat your repo's README like your landing page
Every founder visiting your README is a potential evaluator. Spend 4 hours making it phenomenal. Hero image. Quickstart in 60 seconds. Use cases. FAQ. Discord/community link. **A great README is a sales asset.**

## What NOT to do

- **Don't open-source your moat.** If you have a proprietary algorithm or unique dataset that's the *whole* product, keep it closed. OSS the orbiting tools.
- **Don't pick GPL.** It scares enterprise buyers. Use MIT or Apache 2.0.
- **Don't ship a half-baked OSS project.** It's worse than no project. Buggy READMEs and broken installs become your reputation.
- **Don't expect to monetize OSS users directly.** Monetize the slice they don't want to self-host. The free-to-paid conversion is via *managed cloud* or *enterprise features*, not "premium support" alone.
- **Don't gatekeep the source of your insights.** If you can write a deep-dive blog post about how you architected something, write it. The founders who become the authority on a niche win the niche.

## The lesson

> **Distribution > differentiation, in 2026. Open source IS your distribution.**

You don't need to ship a $4.5B company. You need ONE useful free thing that gets shared in your audience's group chats. **Pick one of these this month:**

- **A:** Your n8n template → publish on GitHub MIT
- **B:** Your prompt library → newsletter lead magnet
- **C:** Your OSS Discovery Engine fork → distribution flywheel

The Discovery Engine you got from this workshop is option C, ready-made. Fork it, brand it, ship it as your own.
