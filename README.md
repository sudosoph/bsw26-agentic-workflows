## What it does

Every morning at 7 AM, this agent:
1. **Listens** to Hacker News, Reddit, and Product Hunt for signals matching your customer profile
2. **Researches** each prospect's company
3. **Drafts** a personalized customer-discovery email in *your* voice (using a `voice.md` file)
4. **Drops** the draft in your Gmail (never sends — you always send)
5. **Follows up** after 5 days if no reply
6. **Sends you** a daily digest at 7:30 AM with what's queued for review

**Cost per run:** ~$0.21 · **Monthly:** ~$6 paid stack · ~$8 max-DIY · **Build time:** 25 minutes.

## Quick start

### 🆓 Free path · zero install · zero credit card · Tier 0

You can run this whole agent for **free** for 14 days, then either upgrade or migrate.

**What you need:**
- [n8n.cloud](https://n8n.cloud) free 14-day trial (no card)
- [Groq](https://console.groq.com) free tier · Llama 3.3 70B (no card)
- [Jina Reader](https://r.jina.ai) for web extraction (no signup needed — just hit `https://r.jina.ai/<URL>`)
- Your existing Google account (Sheets + Drive + Gmail)

**Total cost:** $0 for the first 14 days. After the n8n.cloud trial: pay $24/mo, OR self-host n8n on a $5/mo Hetzner VPS, OR migrate to Make.com's free tier (1,000 ops/month).

**One-click free-tier workflow:** import [`n8n/bsw-growth-agent-lite.json`](./n8n/bsw-growth-agent-lite.json) directly into n8n.cloud · all Anthropic + Firecrawl nodes are pre-swapped to Groq + Jina. Same architecture, $0 stack.

### ⚡ Autopilot setup with a browser agent (~10 min hands-off)

If you have **Claude for Chrome** (Max/Pro subscribers · [claude.com/chrome](https://claude.com/chrome)) or **Gemini in Chrome** or **OpenAI Operator**, an AI browser agent can do the entire signup-and-key-copy phase for you while you make coffee. Paste prompt in [TUTORIAL.md → Autopilot section](./TUTORIAL.md#-autopilot--let-an-ai-browser-agent-do-the-setup-for-you-10-min-hands-off).

### 🧪 Verify your keys before wiring (60-second smoke test)

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-...    \
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...        \
./scripts/test-credentials.sh
```

Catches typos and auth issues before you waste time wiring n8n.

### 💎 Paid path · best quality · Tier 1

If you want best-in-class voice match (Anthropic Sonnet 4.6) and don't mind ~$15–$135/mo:

```bash
gh repo fork sudosoph/bsw-growth-agent --clone
cd bsw-growth-agent
```

Then in [n8n](https://n8n.cloud):
1. **Workflows → Add → Import from File**
2. Upload `n8n/bsw-growth-agent.json`
3. Wire up your credentials (Anthropic, Firecrawl, Google Sheets, Google Drive, Gmail)
4. Replace placeholder IDs in the workflow nodes (your Sheet ID, your `voice.md` file ID)
5. Click **Active** to enable the daily 7 AM cron

Full setup in [TUTORIAL.md](./TUTORIAL.md).

### 🔧 Build from scratch (45 min, learn the architecture)

Follow the 17-step code-along build in **[TUTORIAL.md](./TUTORIAL.md)** — designed for anyone who can configure a Google Sheet.

## The architecture in one screen

```
TRIGGER     cron 7am · manual webhook
   ↓
READ        Sheets("ICP") + Drive("voice.md")     // config-as-files
   ↓
DISCOVERY   Haiku 4.5 + web_search    // sub-agent #1
   ↓        [{ person, signal, source_url, quote, score }]
DEDUPE      against Sheets("Sent")     // idempotency
   ↓
ENRICH      Firecrawl on top-N · Haiku 2-line summary
   ↓
DRAFT       Sonnet 4.6 + voice.md + 5 examples    // sub-agent #2
   ↓
HITL GATE   Gmail.createDraft  ·  NEVER sends
   ↓
DIGEST      Sonnet 4.6 · daily 7:30am             // sub-agent #3
   ↓
LOG         Sheets("Runs") · audit + cost meter
```

Three Claude prompts. Each gets only the context it needs. **Sub-agent decomposition** for cost — cuts your bill 60–70% vs. naïve "Sonnet for everything."

## The 12 patterns this teaches

The `BSW Growth Agent` is built on 12 transferable patterns. Memorize them — they generalize to any agent you'll build.

| # | Pattern | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Cron + webhook triggers | Wake the agent up |
| 2 | **Config-as-files** | Editable behavior, no redeploys |
| 3 | Cascade model selection | 60-70% bill cut · Haiku → Sonnet → Opus |
| 4 | Web search as agent eyes | Claude `web_search` built-in tool |
| 5 | Targeted enrichment | Cheap-fast first, expensive-deep second |
| 6 | Schema-first JSON | Connections that don't break |
| 7 | Idempotent dedup | Re-run safety |
| 8 | **HITL via Gmail drafts** | Brand voice protection · agent never sends |
| 9 | Sub-agent decomposition | Each step gets only the context it needs |
| 10 | Audit log on every action | Trust through visible track record |
| 11 | Cost metering per run | Know your real bill |
| 12 | Follow-up via thread context | Same architecture, different inputs |

---

## 7 other agents on this same stack

Once you've built the BSW Growth Agent, you've built the architecture for any of these. **Different trigger · different search/extract · different output · same skeleton.**

| Agent | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Inbound Triage** | Form fill → research lead → draft response |
| **Competitor Pulse** | Daily diff competitor changelogs · email digest |
| **Support Draft** | Ticket → KB lookup → drafted reply |
| **Content Repurposer** | Blog → tweet thread + LinkedIn + newsletter blurb |
| **Call Notes → CRM** | Recording → notes → CRM update |
| **Investor Update** | Metrics → narrative → drafted email |
| **Onboarding Personalizer** | Signup → enriched welcome series |

## Going to production · the trust ladder

This agent ships at **Stage 2 · Pending Review** of the trust ladder. The agent drafts, you send. As your track record builds (visible in `Sheets("Runs")`), you graduate.

| Stage | What changes | Required guardrails |
|---|---|---|
| **2 · Pending Review** *(default)* | Drafts only · never sends | Schema validation · audit log · do-not-contact filter |
| **3 · Conditional Auto** | Auto-fires drafts where score ≥ 8 AND voice match ≥ 0.85 | + rate limit per recipient · anomaly detection · sandbox isolation |
| **4 · Full Auto** | Fires all · alerts on exceptions | + A/B replay testing · drift detection · automatic rollback |

**Don't deploy at Stage 4 out of the gate.** The 9-second PocketOS database deletion on April 25, 2026 is the cautionary tale. Earn each stage.

## Cost optimization

Same workflow, four cost tiers. Start at Tier 1 this week. Move to Tier 3 when your bill hits ~$50/mo.

| Tier | Stack | Monthly cost |
|---|---|---|
| **All-cloud SaaS** | n8n.cloud + Perplexity + Firecrawl Cloud + Sonnet API | ~$135 |
| **Hybrid** | n8n self-host + Perplexity + Firecrawl Cloud + Sonnet | ~$95 |
| **Lean self-hosted** | n8n + SearXNG + Firecrawl all self · Sonnet API | ~$15 |
| **Maximum DIY** | Above + Qwen 3.6-27B local for classification | ~$8 |
